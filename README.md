# Survival Rate on the Titanic

The following model uses the famous Titanic dataset(from Kaggle) and uses it in a Logistic Regression model to determine is a passenger survived the infamous Titanic ship wreck. The data is first cleaned and encoded. Then we use various metrics to determine if a passenger survived or died depending on the various parameters 

STEPS-
1) Visualize the data in various plots and graphs to determine the missing or noisy data
 
2) Replace or Drop the data so that the regression model wont encounter any error
 
3) Use dummy columns to encode the categorical data into binary one and zeroes
 
4) Fit the data and predict the model values (using sklearn)
 
5) Generate a confusion matrix and classification report to check accuracy etc.
